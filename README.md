# roster-manager

In a hypothetical scenario, I am hired as a contractor to help a university migrate an existing student system to a new platform using C++ language. Since the application already exists, its requirements exist as well. I am responsible for implementing the part of the system based on these requirements. A list of data is provided as part of these requirements. This part of the system is responsible for reading and manipulating the provided data.

The rest is omitted to comply with academic integrity guidelines, but you get the idea.
